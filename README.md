i wanted to explore and learn more about discord and bots, so using the discord.js docs i created a simple bot using node, cron and discord.js that can send scheduled messages in a discord server.

here is a screenshot with the commands available for the bot.

since lots of bots have this functionality, i didn't see value in hosting it however maybe in the future I will. currently, i have a script that launches the bot when i start my pc to set my reminders.
